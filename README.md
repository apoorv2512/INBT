# Diabetes_Analysis
Problem Statement : To build a machine learning model to predict whether an patient have Diabetes or not.

**About The Project**:


This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes in individuals. The model is trained on a dataset of health-related features and target labels indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

**# About The Dataset**

The dataset used for this project contains various health-related features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, along with a binary target variable indicating whether an individual has diabetes or not. The data is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
