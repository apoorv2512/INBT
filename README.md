Here In iNeuBytes, We got 3 projects,

 1: Diabetes Analysis - classification problem
 2: Air Pollution - Regression Problem
 3: Customer Segmentation. - Regression problem, K-mean Clustering.(major project)

 
For classification problem, build a model and predicted and evaluated by metrics classification report and confusion matrix. For regression preprocessing and EDA part is more and build a model and evaluated by MAE, MSE, RMSE. In addition to that for customer segmentation, K-mean clustering --> Elbow method.
